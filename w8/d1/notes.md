# Neural Networks

Neural Networks are parametric models because the number of weights / nodes in the model is predetermined. However Neural Networks in reality act like non-parametric models because the sheer size of the model allows for many of the weights to "zero out"   
  > non parametric models are more adaptable to many kinds of problems

Neural networks are non-linear.

Neural Network types   
- Convolutional
  - Good for making abstractions
- Recurrent
  - can remember previous inputs (good for learning / time series)
- Sequentiol

### Downsides

- Black box model
- needs LOTS of data
- needs LOTS of computing power
