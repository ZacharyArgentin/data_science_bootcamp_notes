# Is programming knowledge required to pursue data science?

![Venn Diagram](img/ds-skills-diagram.jpg)

Math, Programming, and Domain knowledge are all required to be a good data scientist.

# Technical skills
- Domain Expertise
- Mathematics
- Computer Science

### Domain knowledge

A data scientist bridges the gap between the technical and non technical. Domain knowledge is required to understand the business problem and select the right features for the machine learning model.

### Mathematics

Although algorithms can be run without knowing how they work. A strong mathematical base will help with choosing the right algorithm and optimization.

### Computer science

Programming is a vital skill but is not necessarily the most important. The main goal of a data science role is to understand the syntax of the relevant programming language (e.g. Python or R), and try to implement the mathematical concepts using the predefined functions available in the language.

# Non technical skills

- Business awareness
- Soft skills
- Collaborative skills

Non technical skills arguably make up 60% of being a good data scientist.

### Business Awareness

The business problem must be identified and thoroughly understood, so that relevant insights can be collected from the data.

### Communication / Explanation skills

Data Storytelling is more important than obtaining insights from the data itself. The whole purpose of collecting insights is diminished if it is not explained effectively.

### Collaborative skills

Data scientists always work in teams. Deriving good insights from the data is a team effort and the team must work together to make it a success.

# Conclusion
 Problem solving and commitment are what is needed to succeed.
