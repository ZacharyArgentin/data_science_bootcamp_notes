# HTTP requests

HTTP --> Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
TCP --> Transfer Control Protocol

TCP is the connection that a computer makes to a server.
HTTP is the language of the request sent through that connection.

> i.e. http is the structure of the request.

### HTTP methods
- GET
- POST
- PUT
- DELETE

There are more methods than this. GET is the most common.

HTTPS encrypts the data that you send, so that it can't be intercepted and read by other people while it's in transit to the destination.

An HTTP request consists of an endpoint and an HTTP method

> def endpoint:
> - loosely, it's just the URL
> - e.g. google.com/search
